If some of your printer's functions are not included, you may extend this module by adding specialized funtions for your printer in it's own subclass. Refer to [Printer::ESCPOS::Roles::Profile](https://metacpan.org/pod/Printer::ESCPOS::Roles::Profile) and [Printer::ESCPOS::Profiles::Generic](https://metacpan.org/pod/Printer::ESCPOS::Profiles::Generic)\r\n\r\n# ATTRIBUTES\r\n\r\n## driverType\r\n\r\n\"Required attribute\". The driver type to use for your printer. This can be **File**, **Network** or **Serial**. **USB** driver is not implemented yet.\r\nIf you choose **File** or **Serial** driver, you must provide the _deviceFilePath_, for **Network** driver you must provide the _printerIp_ and _printerPort_.\r\n\r\nNetwork driver type:\r\n\r\n    my $printer_id = '192.168.0.10';\r\n    my $port       = '9100';\r\n    my $device = Printer::ESCPOS->new(\r\n        driverType => 'Network',\r\n        deviceIp   => $printer_ip,\r\n        devicePort => $port,\r\n    );\r\n\r\nSerial driver type:\r\n\r\n    my $path = '/dev/ttyACM0';\r\n    $device = Printer::ESCPOS->new(\r\n        driverType     => 'Serial',\r\n        deviceFilePath => $path,\r\n    );\r\n\r\nFile driver type:\r\n\r\n    my $path = '/dev/usb/lp0';\r\n    $device = Printer::ESCPOS->new(\r\n        driverType     => 'File',\r\n        deviceFilePath => $path,\r\n    );\r\n\r\n## profile\r\n\r\nThere are minor differences in ESC POS printers across different brands and models in terms of specifications and extra features. For using special features of a particular brand you may create a sub class in the name space Printer::ESCPOS::Profiles::\\* and load your profile here. I would recommend extending  Generic ( [Printer::ESCPOS::Profiles::Generic](https://metacpan.org/pod/Printer::ESCPOS::Profiles::Generic) ).\r\nUse the following classes as examples.\r\n[Printer::ESCPOS::Profiles::Generic](https://metacpan.org/pod/Printer::ESCPOS::Profiles::Generic)\r\n[Printer::ESCPOS::Profiles::SinocanPSeries](https://metacpan.org/pod/Printer::ESCPOS::Profiles::SinocanPSeries)\r\n\r\nNote that your driver class will have to implement the Printer::ESCPOS::Roles::Profile Interface. This is a Moose Role and can be included in your class with the following line.\r\n\r\n    use Moose;\r\n    with 'Printer::ESCPOS::Roles::Profile';\r\n\r\nBy default the generic profile is loaded but if you have written your own Printer::ESCPOS::Profile::\\* class and want to override the generic class pass the _profile_ Param during object creation.\r\n\r\n    my $device = Printer::ESCPOS->new(\r\n        driverType => 'Network',\r\n        deviceIp   => $printer_ip,\r\n        devicePort => $port,\r\n        profile    => 'USERCUSTOM'\r\n    );\r\n\r\nThe above $device object will use the Printer::ESCPOS::Profile::USERCUSTOM profile.\r\n\r\n## deviceFilePath\r\n\r\nFile path for UNIX device file. e.g. \"/dev/ttyACM0\" this is a mandatory parameter if you are using **File** or **Serial** _driverType_.\r\n\r\n## deviceIP\r\n\r\nContains the IP address of the device when its a network printer. The module creates [IO:Socket::INET](IO:Socket::INET) object to connect to the printer. This can be passed in the constructor.\r\n\r\n## devicePort\r\n\r\nContains the network port of the device when its a network printer. The module creates [IO:Socket::INET](IO:Socket::INET) object to connect to the printer. This can be passed in the constructor.\r\n\r\n## baudrate\r\n\r\nWhen used as a local serial device you can set the _baudrate_ of the printer too. Default (38400) will usually work, but not always. \r\n\r\n## serialOverUSB\r\n\r\nSet this value to 1 if you are connecting your printer using the USB Cable but it shows up as a serial device and you are using the **Serial** driver.\r\n\r\n## printer\r\n\r\nUse this attribute to send commands to the printer\r\n\r\n    $device->printer->setFont('a');\r\n    $device->printer->write(\"blah blah blah\\n\");\r\n\r\n# USAGE\r\n\r\nRefer to the following manual to get started with [Printer::ESCPOS](https://metacpan.org/pod/Printer::ESCPOS)\r\n\r\n- [Printer::ESCPOS::Manual](https://metacpan.org/pod/Printer::ESCPOS::Manual)\r\n\r\n## Quick usage summary in steps:\r\n\r\n1. Create a device object $device by providing parameters for one of the supported printer types. Call $device->printer->init to initialize the printer.\r\n2. call write() and other Text formatting functions on $device->printer for the data to be sent to the printer. Make sure to end it all with a linefeed $device->printer->lf().\r\n3. Then call the print() method to dispatch the sequences from the module buffer to the printer\r\n\r\n     $device->printer->print()\r\n\r\nNote: While you may call print() after every single command code, this is not advisable as some printers tend to choke up if you send them too many print commands in quick succession. To avoid this, aggregate the data to be sent to the printer with write() and other text formatting functions and then send it all in one go using print() at the very end.\r\n\r\n# NOTES\r\n\r\n- In Serial mode if the printer prints out garbled characters instead of proper text, try specifying the baudrate parameter when you create the printer object. The default baudrate is set at 38400\r\n\r\n     $device = Printer::ESCPOS->new(\r\n         driverType     => 'Serial',\r\n         deviceFilePath => $path,\r\n         baudrate       => 9600,\r\n     );\r\n\r\n- For ESC-P codes refer the guide from Epson [http://support.epson.ru/upload/library\\_file/14/esc-p.pdf](http://support.epson.ru/upload/library_file/14/esc-p.pdf)\r\n\r\n# SUPPORT\r\n\r\n## Bugs / Feature Requests\r\n\r\nPlease report any bugs or feature requests through github at \r\n[https://github.com/shantanubhadoria/perl-printer-escpos/issues](https://github.com/shantanubhadoria/perl-printer-escpos/issues).\r\nYou will be notified automatically of any progress on your issue.\r\n\r\n## Source Code\r\n\r\nThis is open source software.
